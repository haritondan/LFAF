# Laboratory Work 2

### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: Hariton Dan

## Objectives:

* Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.


* Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added: 

    a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

    b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.


* According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton and do the following tasks:

    a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.
  
    b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.
    
    c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.
    
    d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point):
      
        - You can use external libraries, tools or APIs to generate the figures/diagrams.
        - Your program needs to gather and send the data about the automaton and the lib/tool/API return the visual representation.

## Implementation description

* Since I left comments on my code I didn't left any comments here.

  For the conversion from NDFA TO DFA implementation, I tried to implement it but I did get a lot of error the code in
  in the /NFAtoDFA.py file



* The given code defines a function chomsky_hierarchy that checks whether a grammar belongs to Type 3 (regular) in Chomsky's hierarchy of grammars. It examines the grammar's productions and verifies that they satisfy certain conditions for being regular, such as the length of productions, the types of symbols used, and the presence of epsilon (empty) productions. If all productions meet these conditions, the function returns "Type 3 (regular)" indicating that the grammar is regular.
```
def chomsky_hierarchy(grammar):
    # Check if the grammar is Type 3 (regular)
    if all(len(production) <= 2 and (production[0].islower() or production[0].isupper()) and
           (len(production) == 1 or production[1].isupper() or production[1] == 'Îµ') for symbol in grammar for
           production in grammar[symbol]):
        return "Type 3 (regular)"
```
* The given code defines a function fa_to_rg that converts a finite automaton (FA) into a regular grammar (RG). It iterates over the FA components and builds productions for the RG. It handles productions for the starting state separately and then adds productions for the remaining states. The function modifies the productions dictionary and nonterminals set to represent the RG.
```
def fa_to_rg(Q, Sigma, delta, q0, F):
    # Step 1: Initialize the productions and nonterminals
    productions = defaultdict(list)
    nonterminals = set()
    for q in Q:
        nonterminals.add(q)

    # Step 2: Add the productions for the starting state
    start_productions = []
    for symbol, next_state in delta[q0].items():
        if next_state in F:
            start_productions.append(symbol + "S'")
        else:
            start_productions.append(symbol + "S")
        productions[q0].append(symbol + "S")

    if start_productions:
        nonterminals.add("S'")
        productions["S'"].extend(start_productions)

    # Step 3: Add the productions for the remaining states
    for q in Q:
        for symbol, next_state in delta[q].items():
            if next_state in F:
                productions[q].append(symbol + "S'")
            else:
                productions[q].append(symbol + next_state)
```


* The given code defines a function is_deterministic that checks if a finite automaton (FA) is deterministic. The function takes as input the set of states (Q), alphabet (Sigma), and transition function (delta).
The code iterates over each state in Q and checks the next states reachable from that state for each symbol in Sigma. If there are duplicate next states for any symbol, indicating non-determinism, the function returns False. Otherwise, if all next states for each symbol are unique, it returns True, indicating that the FA is deterministic
```
def is_deterministic(Q, Sigma, delta):
    for state in Q:
        next_states = [delta[state][symbol] for symbol in Sigma]
        if len(set(next_states)) != len(Sigma):
            return False
    return True
```

Type 3 (regular)

* Results for the FA code with the determine the type of FA function.

```
Regular grammar:
S' -> bS
S' -> aS
q3 -> aS'
q3 -> bS'
q0 -> bS
q0 -> bq0
q0 -> aq1
q0 -> aS
q1 -> aq2
q1 -> bq1
q2 -> aq2
q2 -> bS'
The FA is non-deterministic
